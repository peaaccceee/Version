# Version

**Version** is my cozy little corner of the web where I’m learning Git, GitHub, and file structure — one commit at a time.

## Features

- Basic HTML & CSS file setup
- Folder structure: `src`, `images`, and `README.md`
- Organized using Git and pushed to GitHub

## How to Run It

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peaaccceee/version.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Done
